This is my personal blog.

I am a brazilian, born and living in Sao Paulo.

I am a full stack developer.

I studied physics in the college.

I enjoy to play guitar and listen classic rock.

I like sports in general, and recently I am trainning triatlhon.

I am a decent chess player with some good performances in the local club.

And my political stance is libertarian.

So you can expect posts in these topics :).
