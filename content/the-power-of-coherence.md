Let's start with a Linus Torvalds quote:
> I like offending people, because I think people who get offended should be
> offended.

This quote sounds a lot aggresive. But it has a lot meaning behind it in my
opinion.

I think that one of the most difficult parts of growing up is to became a
coherent person. But what means to be coherent? And why this is so important?

<!-- more -->

I understand coherence in personal relations as what economists call the Golden
Rule:
> Treat Others the Way You Want to Be Treated.

For example:
 - I don't like to be robbed! So I will not rob other people.
 - I don't like to be beatten! So I will not beat other people.
 - I don't like to be killed! So I will not kill other people.
 - I don't care if people question my work! So I will question other's work.
 - I don't care if my friends joke with me! So I will joke with them too.

And the list goes on...

Every time you violate the golden rule some people will realize. But worse than
that you will realize, consciously or not.

And every time some of your friends ask you about something you clearly don't
like but that you're still doing with other people, the natural reaction is to
be offended.

Nobody born coherent. Even people who read a lot and try hard to be coherent
will fail sometimes. This is a fact that must be recognized.

But you can improve your coherence in your daily attitudes. You will improve
your personal relationships with your friends, with your co-workers and
partners, and most importantly with your family.

In my opinion, the first step is not to be offended when someone points out
some reasonable criticism of your attitude towards other people. Try to
understand logically what the person is trying to say. And if criticism proves
right, you must understand that that person cares about you. Because saying
unpleasant things takes courage and most people react very badly to any kind of
criticism. So you should thank the person who pointed out your mistake, and try
improve your attitude from now on.

The second important thing is to return the favor, so you should always shows
the things you believe are wrong. And don't be afraid to talk and expose what
you believe to be wrong. Understand that in this process you will be
disappointed with the reaction of many people, and often people will show you
that they are not the ones who are wrong, but you in your criticism. That's
good, you should always take all this as a chance to grow as a person.

In the words of Richard Feynman:
> As I get older, I realize being wrong isn't a bad thing like they teach you 
> in school. It is an opportunity to learn something.

And lastly, don't create gods where there's only one human being of flesh and
blood. Everyone, no matter how intelligent he is, no matter how much you love
the person, no matter how honest and humble the person is, sometimes he will be
incoherent. Sometimes they will say things that you logically see that are
wrong (consciously or not), but your heart will not see what your mind has
seen. This is the hardest part. Admire people as people not as something more
than that. Take the good lessons of your idols, but learn to critically analyze
their mistakes.

Now we can connect this ideas to business. 

When you create a business, or you are selling your job as an employee or as a
service, you should realize what your goal is. And always tell and explain to
people what you're doing and how it fits into their goals. This is the only
honest attitude you can have when doing a job, whatever the type of contract.
If you do this, you will get a lot of criticism, you will get many suggestions
and many comments. Some people will start rejecting your work, but some
opportunities will also appear. Being honest about your goals and how they fit
into your customers' goals is very difficult, but a really enjoyable
experience. After some inevitable adjustments being made you will be with a
more aligned team and customers who actually require your services. This is the
market, serving people who really need what you are doing and working with
people who believe in the same goals. So your pessimism about the future, your
complaints about your customers and staff will be reduced, in the process you
will probably have to change yourself.

In Einstein words:
> Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different
> results

No one is 100% coherent, all without a single exception can improve. The first
step is to recognize this truth, but instead of pointing the finger at the
faces of others, let's start with what really matters: myself. Being more
coherent as a person I'll be more relaxed about criticism, it's going to be
very difficult for other people to offend me, suddenly I'll be talking to
everyone about any subject in a very relaxed way, even with people who disagree
with me.

In business, all incoherence costs money that represents the chance to grow and
cause real impact on society to be reduced. Incoherence drives people who are
aligned with your goals to leave your team and lose important customers, making
it harder to achieve your goal whatever it is.

Be more coherent is deeply related with your grow as a person and as a
business man. It's hard, but it's certainly going to be worth it.
